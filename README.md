- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point for the application.
- It will contain the user interface elements, such as buttons, text input fields, and a display area.
- The index.html file will also include the necessary JavaScript code to interact with the Flask application.

**2. create_app.html**
- This HTML file will be used to create a new web application.
- It will contain a form with fields for the application name, description, and other relevant details.
- The create_app.html file will also include the necessary JavaScript code to submit the form data to the Flask application.

**3. view_apps.html**
- This HTML file will be used to view the existing web applications.
- It will display a list of all the applications, along with their names, descriptions, and other relevant details.
- The view_apps.html file will also include the necessary JavaScript code to interact with the Flask application.
